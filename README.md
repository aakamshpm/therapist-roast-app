# !THERAPIST‚Ñ¢ üé≠

## Basic Details

### Name: Aakamsh P M

### Project Description

!THERAPIST‚Ñ¢ is a satirical AI-powered "therapy" chat app that delivers brutal honesty, sarcasm, and emotional damage instead of actual help. It‚Äôs an interactive web experience where users chat with a fake AI therapist that roasts them, triggers fake paywalls, and assigns pointless therapy tasks‚Äîpurely for entertainment!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People have too much self-esteem and not enough exposure to 90s website nostalgia. The world is lacking a platform where getting roasted by an AI is the goal, not the side effect.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

An intentionally ugly, retro-styled web app where users can confess their life problems only to receive savage burns, fake paywall popups, and "therapy" tasks that are either impossible or just deeply embarrassing. All powered by Gemini AI and 100% guaranteed to hurt your feelings (not heal them).
